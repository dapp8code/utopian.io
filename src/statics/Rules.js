      <h1>General Rules</h1>

      <p>
        These are the rules that apply, if you want to submit a contribution to Utopian. If you have more general questions about Utopian please refer to our <NavLink className="CookiePolicyBanner__PolicyLink" to="/faq">Frequently Asked Questions</NavLink>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Failing to adhere to one or more of the rules set below will lead to the immediate rejection of your contribution. Please be sure to read and understand the rules before submitting a contribution.</b>

      <p>
        <b>Supervisors may revert an accepted / rejected contribution.</b>
      </p>

      <h2>Rules vs Guidelines</h2>
      <p>
        Some of the instructions in this document are designated as <i>guidelines</i> in italics. Failure to follow these guidelines will not lead to immediate rejection, but instead to a notification from the category Moderator asking the submission to be corrected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repeated failures to follow guidelines may lead to the rejection of your submissions.
      </p>

      <h2>Bans and Downvotes</h2>
      <p>
        The following behaviors may lead to a temporary or permanent ban from Utopian:

        <li>The writing style should be professional and clear.</li>
